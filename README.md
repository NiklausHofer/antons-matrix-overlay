Welcome to an overlay of packages related to the [Matrix](https://matrix.org) chat!

The quality of this overlay is "works for me". Unfortunately, I do not have
the skills/resources to test everything properly, though I am working on it.

If something is not working for you, please, let me know! You can leave a bug
report or a feature request at
[GitLab issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/anton.molyboha.group/gentoo/overlays/matrix/-/issues)
or
[Gentoo Bugzilla](https://bugs.gentoo.org/) (If using Bugzilla, make sure to CC: anton.stay.connected@gmail.com)

I'll be happy to add most matrix-related packages if you help test that they
"work for you". Many bridges and maubot plugins are not in the repository just
because I'm not using them and thus cannot test the package.
